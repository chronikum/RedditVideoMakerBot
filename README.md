## Contributing & Ways to improve 📈

In its current state, this bot does exactly what it needs to do. However, lots of improvements can be made.

I have tried to simplify the code so anyone can read it and start contributing at any skill level. Don't be shy :) contribute!

- [lol] Creating better documentation and adding a command line interface.
